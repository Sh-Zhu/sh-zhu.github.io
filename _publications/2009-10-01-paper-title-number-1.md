The invention provides an incoming call processing method and a mobile terminal. The method comprises the steps that when a mobile terminal is in a bright-screen state, and the desktop is not shown, when an incoming call is detected, the information of the user making the incoming call is obtained; if the user's information is the information of a stranger, a warning pops up in the form of a preset prompt. The incoming call processing method solves the problem that a user is interrupted by an incoming call in the process of using a mobile terminal. The incoming calls can be effectively sieved and filtered. After the user returns to the desktop, a prompt pops out to inform the user to deal with the filtered incoming call, and therefore the user's experience of using a mobile terminal is enhanced.
