The invention provides a control method for mute state and mobile terminal. The method comprises that if a first mobile terminal is in a non-silence state, whether a second mobile terminal in a first mute state or a second mute state exists is detected in a preset range away from the first mobile terminal; when the second mobile terminal in a first mute state or a second mute state exists is detected, a notice of entering into the first mute state or not is displayed. If a response message for entering into the first mute state, aiming at the notice, is received, the first mobile terminal is controlled to enter into the first mute state. If the first mobile terminal is in the first mute state, an enquiry of asking maintaining the first mute state or not is displayed. If a second response message of not maintaining the first mute state, aiming at the enquiry, is received, the first mobile terminal is controlled to enter into non-silence state. The method is capable of controlling the mute state flexibly according to actual scenario, which improves the user experience.
