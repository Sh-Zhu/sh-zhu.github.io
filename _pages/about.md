I am always eager to learn new knowledge and challenge myself. I had been a software engineer for three years. My programming skills, teamwork ability and problems solving ability have been greatly improved during that period. Amazed by the rapid development of digital society, I decided to further my studies to keep abreast of the times. Now, I am an ongoing Master student of the EIT Digital programme, which combines cutting-edge technical fields, such as artificial intelligence and robotics, with a strong focus on developing skills in innovation and entrepreneurship. I believe that I will be a fuller and better person after completing the study.
