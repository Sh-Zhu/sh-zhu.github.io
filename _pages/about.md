Being born in China, having studied & worked in China & Finland and currently based in Sweden, as a student of the EIT program, I am doing the second year of my M.Sc. study in Intelligent Autonomous Systems.

I am interested in applications of Artificial Intelligence, especially in the mobile platform which could benefit as many individual users as possible. I have hand-on experience in AI (machine learning, deep learning, reinforcement learning), parallel computing and mobile development. Meanwhile, I am studying web application development. My career goal now is to be a full-stack developer with AI background.
